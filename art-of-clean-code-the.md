  Writing clean code: the principles:
    1.  Think about the big picture
    2.  Stand on the shoulders of giants
            use libs
    3.  Code for people, not machines
            people including your future self
    4.  Use the right names
            4.1 descriptive name
                  clearer better: usd_to_eur(amount) > dollar_to_euro(amount) 
            4.2 unambiguous names
            4.3 pronounceable names
            4.4 named constants, not magic numbers
    5.  Adhere to standards
    6.  Use comments
            but dont overdo it
    7.  Avoid unnecessary comments
            dont comment whats self-explinary, may confuse and clutter makes code harder to read
    8.  The principle of least surprise
    9.  Dont repeat yourself
            "DRY"
            "WET" - waste everyone's time
    10. Single responsibility principle 
    11. Test
    12. Small is Beautiful
        Avoid "God Objects" / monolithic code blocks
    13. The law of Demeter
        An object should only communicate with its immediate neighbors
    14.
